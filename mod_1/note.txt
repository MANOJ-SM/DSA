// overview of Data strutures 

data sturtures :  are the tools that are designed to organinze and store information effeciently 
they facilitate easier retrival and manipulation of data.

Alogorithm : sequence of insructions that are used to solve a problem or perform a task.

DS - save space , fast retrival , 

** type of task we have to do and type of data we want to store decide which DS we should use 
* efficient dS simplify algorithm design 

orgsnizing dat is imp bcoz it helps in bulidind websites and analyzing data 

// types of data struture 

1) Linear Data Structures :

Linear Data Structures are a type of data structure where data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly where Each element has a previous and next adjacent, except for the first and last elements.
