//1. overview of Data strutures 

data sturtures :  are the tools that are designed to organinze and store information effeciently 
they facilitate easier retrival and manipulation of data.

Alogorithm : sequence of insructions that are used to solve a problem or perform a task.

DS - helps to organix=ze the data effeciently , save space , fast retrival , 
Algm - operation that we perform on that oranganized data.

** type of task we have to do and type of data we want to store decide which DS we should use 
** efficient dS simplify algorithm design 

orgsnizing data is imp bcoz it helps in bulidind websites and analyzing data 

// 2.types of data struture 

1) Linear Data Structures :

Linear Data Structures are a type of data structure where data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly where Each piece of data connected to its  previous(predecessor) and next adjacent(successor), except for the first and last elements.

the 1st ele to be added is either accessed 1st or removed first
the last ele to be added is either accessed last or removed last

common linear ds :

1)Array (fixed size)
2)Linkid list ( dynamic size)
3)stack ( dynamic size)
4)queue ( dynamic size)


2) Non-Linear Data Structures :
Non-Linear Data Structures are a type of data structure where data is not organized in sequential manner insted it form a web like structure ( loops / branchs ) where each element is connected to multiple other elements.

1)Trees
2)Graph
3)Heap

** the way elements are organzised or arranged differentiate blw linear and non linear DS

// 3.Importance of Algorithms 

choosing an algo for task depends on
1)size of the problem
2)resourse available
3)how quickly we need solution 


an effecient algo is determiened by time and space complexity analysis
